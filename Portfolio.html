        <h2 class="abt">About me</h2>
        <p class="about">Hi my name is Akira Singer I am 16 years old going into my junior year of highschool.
             I am going to castle highschool. I have always had a interest in computers from a young age. My dad has always also had a interest in computers that cause me to be exposed to them at a young age.
              At first I would only want Youtube and play video games on them. But as I grow older I have opened up to more things.
               I now do much more than just watch videos and play games. I have a strong interest in music and coding. I also have a interest in fashion.
                But my coding interest started when I was in middle school and had a class that consisted of learning to type and code. 
                It was very simple coding but I was just really discovering it.But I caught on fast and enjoyed it. It is now one of my hobbys along with graphic design.</p>

            <p>At a young age I have had a fascination in photography.
              I like the aethstetic certain photos give off so when I am
              taking photos I will try and take them in the way that will
              cause them to give off the same aethstetic.</p>

            <p>I have recently started to become interested in fashion.
              I like having a wide choice over clothing and I also like
              making outfits that I think match or look good. I also 
              would like to maybe have my own brand one day.</p>
